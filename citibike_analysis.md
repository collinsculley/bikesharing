# NYC Citi Bike Analysis

Preliminary research was conducted to develop insight and analysis for existing Citi Bike data, available for New York City.  As a green user of Tableau, bike-sharing data for NYC in the month of August was used to gain an understanding of the Tableau platform and its functionality.  Exploring the overwhelmingly large CSV dataset in the Tableau environment allowed for clear visualizations to better understand the raw data and provided a clear indication that Citi Bike NYC is a high-volume business with a large customer base for one of Americaâ€™s most populous metropolitan cities.

### Question

How can the researched data for NYC indicate that implementation of Citi Bike in Des Moines could be successful?  The mere difference in population between the two cities would suggests that my findings would not render a course of action, but the total volume of NYC was so overwhelming that it required further examination.

### NYC Citi Bike Findings

Nearly 2.5 million rides were conducted in NYC for the month of August 2019.  With a massive bike fleet of almost 14,000, rider start and end locations are mapped to showcase the most popular areas of use, indicating a concentration in lower Manhattan.  It also became evident that a majority of rides were made by subscribers of Citi Bike, which should be noted since that indicates a captive audience for repeat business.

### Translation To Application In Des Moines

Since Citi Bike is currently only available in New York City, and a majority of rides are known to be made by subscribers, the ride production can be linked to the population as a captive audience.  Population differences between the two cities was captured from the US Census Bureau to provide an accurate percentage for application.  With only 2.6% of the population size, Des Moines would have captured over 60,000 rides for the month of August 2019.  A smaller initial investment would be required for the bike fleet, pointing to an opportunity for implementation to the cities already established bike trail system.

### Station Implementation In Des Moines

A large concentration of rides was noted for lower Manhattan and CalcMaps was used to plot the area of highest use (10 sq/mi).  Physical boundaries of land and user ride lengths pointed to large numbers of rides being conducted within the 10 mile territory.  The same territory size was applied to downtown Des Moines and perfectly aligned with the existing bike trail system and main attractions of downtown.

### Existing Des Moines Infrastructure = Potential Success

From the Des Moines CVB website, it was evident that there is already a thriving downtown community, full of points of interest within the existing network of streets and trails.  The abundance of maps available for visitors and residents confirms that the downtown area is easily navigated.  As the trend to go green and reduce emmissions continues in this country, traversing a congested metropolitan city via bike, without the burden or commitment of owning your own, Citi Bike would be thrive as an expansion here.
